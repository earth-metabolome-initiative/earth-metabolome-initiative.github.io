## Help Us Reveal and Preserve Earth’s Hidden Chemistry

At the Earth Metabolome Initiative, we believe that the molecular language of life — the chemistry inside every plant, microbe, and biome — is one of the planet’s greatest untapped treasures.

Our mission is bold, urgent, and entirely public:

- To document the world's chemodiversity, make this knowledge open to all, and use it to help conserve global biodiversity.

From deep forests to desert soils, from botanical gardens to remote oceans, our team works to:

- 🌍 Build libraries of natural samples and chemicals from every corner of the Earth.
- 🔬 Explore the metabolome — the full set of chemicals produced by living organisms — using advanced tools like mass spectrometry.
- 💾 Establish a free and Open electronic ressource so that scientists, educators, and conservationists can use this knowledge to understand and protect life.
- 🤝 Train and connect a global network of researchers, students, and institutions.
- 🌳 Support conservation directly, by informing ecosystem protection and helping create new protected areas.
- 📚 Inspire the next generation to value chemodiversity — the invisible, essential side of biodiversity.

## 💚 Your Support Matters

As a non-profit, we rely on donations to carry out fieldwork, maintain data infrastructure, and make our resources freely available to all.
Every contribution — large or small — helps us map, share, and safeguard the chemistry of life on Earth.
