At the moment we are launching the Earth Metabolome Initiative.

- We have started gathering a consortium of supporting researchers see {{< link members />}}
- We apply to funding opportunities
- We are working on the Digital Botanical Gardens Initiative (DBGI) which is designed as a pilot for the EMI. Have a look at www.dbgi.org for more information and at our ongoing [Open DBGI Notebook](https://www.dbgi.org/dendron-dbgi/)

More soon...
