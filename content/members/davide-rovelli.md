Davide Rovelli is an Italian PhD student in Food Chemistry

## Collaboration statement

I am interested in contributing to the Earth Metabolome Initiative by providing my expertise and passsion chemistry and mass spectrometry. My experience at [University of Parma](https://saf.unipr.it/), where I work on exploring the potential phytochemical diversity of food by-products matrices through metabolomics and mass spectrometry, to identify bioactive compounds, and assess their potential applications in nutraceuticals.  I am particularly committed to advancing open science practices, fostering collaborative approaches to large-scale metabolomics to uncover and understand Nature’s vast chemical diversity.

I foresee the following contributions:

* Help with mass spectrometry data processing tools
* Help with collecting plant samples
