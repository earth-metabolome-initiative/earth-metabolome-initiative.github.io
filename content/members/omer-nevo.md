Omer is an evolutionary ecologist focusing on the ecology and evoltuion of wild fruit chemical diversity

## Collaboration statement

I have years of experience sampling and analyzing volatile organic compounds from non-model wild species, primarily across the tropics. My group has also worked on primary metabolite diversity and non-volatiles.

I foresee the following contributions:

- Method development, particularly for sampling in remote locations
- Analysis of metabolites
- Making sense of chemical diversity - connecting chemicals to ecological processes
