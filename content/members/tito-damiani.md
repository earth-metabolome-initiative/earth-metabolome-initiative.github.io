Tito Damiani is an Italian researcher and open science activist.

## Collaboration statement

I am interested in contributing to the Earth Metabolome Initiative by sharing my expertise in mass spectrometry, computational metabolomics, and natural products chemistry. My experience in the [Pluskal Lab](https://pluskal.group.uochb.cz/en) at [IOCB Prague](https://www.uochb.cz/en), where I work(ed) on plant natural products discovery and biosynthetic pathway elucidation via large-scale multi-omics approaches, aligns with the goals of the Earth Metabolome Initiative. I am particularly committed to advancing open science practices, promoting collaborative approaches to large-scale metabolomics, and integrating multi-omics datasets to explore Nature’s chemical diversity.

I foresee the following contributions:

* Providing expertise in analytical and computational metabolomics
* Help with mass spectrometry data processing tools (e.g., mzmine software, MassQL query language)
* Help with collecting plant samples
