## Collaboration statement

I am excited to express my interest in joining the Earth Metabolome Initiative. My background in metabolomics mass spectrometry and natural products aligns closely with EMI’s goals to map and understand global chemical diversity. I bring experience in high-resolution MS, natural product annotation, and metabolomics, and I am eager to contribute to shared data resources, method development, and global sampling efforts. I look forward to collaborating with the EMI community to advance our understanding of Earth’s metabolome.
