Parra is a Costa Rican scientist dedicated to integrating metabolomics with other omics technologies to study natural products.

## Collaboration statement

I am interested in contributing to the Earth Metabolome Initiative by sharing my expertise in metabolomics and natural product chemistry. I am a research associate at the National Center for Biotechnology Innovations (CENIBiot) and the Natural Products Research Center (CIPRONA) at the University of Costa Rica. My work at CENIBiot, where I coordinate the chemical analysis unit, and my experience in the biodiscovery of natural products could be enriched by the Earth Metabolome Initiative, allowing me to contribute to the project.

I foresee the following contributions:

- Facilitating compliance with national regulations for biodiversity access permits in Costa Rica.
- Collecting and processing samples in Costa Rica.
- Acquiring and analysing HRMS and NMR data.
