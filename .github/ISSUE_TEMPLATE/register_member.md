Donat is Swiss myrmecologist and open access activist. 

## Collaboration statement

I am interested in contributing to the Earth Metabolome Initiative by providing my expertise in myrmecology and open access advocacy. My experience at [Plazi](https://plazi.org/), where I work on digitizing and making biodiversity data accessible, aligns with the goals of the Earth Metabolome Initiative to promote open science and data sharing.

I foresee the following contributions:
- Providing expertise in litterature digitization and data management.
- Help in taxonomical identification of insects.
- Help in collection of insect samples.



```
